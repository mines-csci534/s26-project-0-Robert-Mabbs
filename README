Project 0

The purpose of the project is to familiarize you with symbolic
reasoning and the Common Lisp development environment.

Please take the time to setup the Lisp development environment
(explained below). IF YOU DO NOT SETUP A REASONABLE DEVELOPMENT
ENVIRONMENT, THE OTHER COURSE PROJECTS WILL BE /EXTREMELY/ DIFFICULT.


PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS
====================


1. Form groups of 2-4 to work on this project.  You may create a
   github team in the course organization for your group.

2. From the github.com interface for this repo, click `Use this
   template` to import the starter code.  Create a new, private repo,
   within the course organization beginning with the prefix
   `CURRENT_SEMESTER-project-0-` and followed by your team name, e.g.,
   s23-project-0-my-group.

3. Give all group members access to the new repo.  The configuration
   option is under the `Settings` tab and the `Collaborators & teams`
   option.

4. Clone the repo.

        git clone git@github.com:mines-csci534/CURRENT_SEMESTER-project-0-TEAM

5. Add all group members' names to the `AUTHORS` file.

6. Complete the missing code (marked with (TODO)) in project-0.lisp

7. Answer the report questions in project-0-report.tex.

8. Push your code changes to your group repo in the course
   organization before the project deadline.  At the project deadline,
   the instructor will download for grading all repositories in the
   course organization beginning with the prefix
   `CURRENT_SEMESTER-project-0-`.

9. Submit your report as a PDF on canvas. Include all group members'
   names in the submitted PDF (only one group member needs to submit).


LISP ENVIRONEMENT SETUP
=======================

Use SBCL (http://sbcl.org/) and Emacs/SLIME
(https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) on Linux to work on the
project.  Your code will be graded using SBCL on Linux.

You may use SBCL on any of the following:
- Your own computer
- A virtual machine
- The isengard.mines.edu server
- The ALAMODE Lab (BB136)

SBCL Setup
----------
SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) is high-performance Common Lisp system.

On Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install sbcl

Other platforms: http://sbcl.org/platform-table.html

Quicklisp/SLIME Setup
---------------------

Quicklisp (https://www.quicklisp.org/) is a lisp package manager.

SLIME (https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) is the Superior Lisp
Interaction Mode for Emacs.

    wget https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
    sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp \
         --eval '(quicklisp-quickstart:install)' \
         --eval '(ql:add-to-init-file)' \
         --eval '(ql:quickload "quicklisp-slime-helper")' \
         --eval '(quit)'

The above call to SBCL will print several commands at the end to add
to your ~/.emacs file.  Add these commands to your ~/.emacs file.

Finally, to improve security, set a password for slime connections:

    (umask 077 && openssl rand 14 -base64 > ~/.slime-secret)

Grading
=======

Your code will be run for grading using (approximately) the following
procedure:

    timeout -s 9 30 sbcl \
            --noinform  \
            --disable-debugger \
            --load "project-0.lisp" \
            --load "test-case.lisp"

YOUR CODE NEEDS TO PRODUCE THE CORRECT RESULT TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR
EACH TESTCASE. MAKE SURE YOUR CODE LOADS CLEANLY WITHOUT COMPILATION
ERRORS, EXTRA I/O, OR OTHER SIDE EFFECTS.

Some of the test files are provided in the `./test/` directory.

FAQ
===

Q: I want to do the project under MacOS X.  What should I do?

A: The above instructions for SLIME under Linux should mostly work for
   MacOS X as well.  You may find one of the MacOS X package managers,
   such as Homebrew or MacPorts, to be convenient for installing SBCL
   and Emacs.  However, the instructor will be able to provide
   only limited support for MacOS X. To avoid grading errors due to
   version incompabilities, please check that your code works
   correctly on the isengard server or the ALAMODE workstations.

Q: I want to do the project under Microsoft Windows.  What should I do?

A: The instructor is not able to provide support for Microsoft
   Windows.  To avoid grading errors due to version incompabilities,
   please check that your code works correctly on the isengard server
   or the ALAMODE workstations.
